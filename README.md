# Car Lead Conversion Prediction

This project tackles the challenge of predicting whether an online car lead will convert into a sale. The solution applies machine learning to help dealerships identify high-quality leads at the moment they are created, improving sales efficiency and conversion rates.

## Problem Statement
Car dealerships receive thousands of online leads each week, but only a small fraction result in sales. This project builds a predictive model that assigns a probability of conversion to each lead, enabling sales teams to prioritize effectively.

## Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis to identify patterns  
- Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models  
- Selection of the best-performing model for lead scoring  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
