#  Car Lead Conversion Prediction

Welcome to the Car Lead Conversion Prediction project! In this challenge, we're tackling a real-world business problem: predicting whether a lead will convert into a car sale. Our goal is to build a powerful machine learning model that helps dealerships prioritize high-quality leads.

## Problem Statement

Car dealerships receive thousands of online leads every week. But only a small percentage convert into actual sales. This project aims to predict the probability of conversion at the moment the lead is created, helping sales teams focus their energy on leads that matter most.
